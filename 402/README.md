# Priciple
It requires to use a monotonous stack to solve this problem. A monotonous stack perform as follows:  
If a new element is larger than the last element in the stack, then the new element replaces it.

# Solving Steps:
1. Use a list as a monotonous stack. We can use pop() and append() operations.
2. Use a counter c to count replacing times.

# Conclusion:
The boundary conditions is a little bit annoying.

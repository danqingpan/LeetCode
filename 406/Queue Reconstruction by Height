# Principle
The way to solve this problem rely on the fact that we can always adjust the smallest element in a queue without disturbing other elements.  
So we sort the list to make larger elements in the front and we adjust smallest elements to the correct position every time.

## Solving Steps:
1. Sort by the height to let higher value in the front. If the height is same, then let smaller second value in the front. This is natural.
2. Adjust the position of the smallest height, insert it to the correct position

## Conclusion:
This problem is a little bit tricky.
